# AES Encryption and Decryption using `pycryptodome`

This Python program demonstrates how to perform AES encryption and decryption using the `pycryptodome` library. It generates a random AES key and IV (Initialization Vector), encrypts a plaintext message, and then decrypts it back to the original message. The ciphertext is displayed in hexadecimal format for better readability.

## Libraries Used

- **pycryptodome**: A self-contained cryptographic library for Python that provides various cryptographic functions like AES encryption.
- **binascii**: A module in Python for converting binary data to ASCII-encoded binary representations (e.g., converting binary ciphertext to hexadecimal).

## Features

- **AES Encryption**: The program uses AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) with a randomly generated key and IV.
- **Hexadecimal Ciphertext**: The ciphertext is converted to hexadecimal format for readability.
- **Secure Random Key and IV Generation**: The key and IV are generated using secure random number generation.
- **Padding Handling**: The program automatically handles padding for encryption and decryption.

## Installation

Before you run the program, make sure you have `pycryptodome` installed. If not, install it via `pip`.

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install pycryptodome
```

### Step 2: Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository-name.git
cd your-repository-name
```

## How to Use

### Step 1: Modify the `main.py`

You can modify the `plaintext` variable in the `main.py` file to change the message you want to encrypt. Here's how the code works:

1. **Key and IV Generation**: A random 128-bit AES key and a random 16-byte IV are generated.
2. **Encryption**: The plaintext message is encrypted using the AES algorithm in CFB (Cipher Feedback) mode.
3. **Hexadecimal Output**: The ciphertext is output in hexadecimal format for easy readability.
4. **Decryption**: The ciphertext is decrypted back to the original plaintext using the same key and IV.

### Step 2: Run the Script

To run the program, use the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
python main.py
```

### Example Output

```bash
Key: 0a0b12d34c56f7128f96da78b32b4a0c
IV: b93f2c5a31f1ad5c4f0c22f9d87ef9ed
Plaintext: This is a secret message!
Ciphertext (Hex): 1f07da3e6a90c6fdd6ff6d4f38b1f8fe
Decrypted Text: This is a secret message!
```

### Step 3: View the Results

- The **Key** and **IV** are displayed in hexadecimal format.
- The **Ciphertext** is also shown in hexadecimal format.
- The **Decrypted Text** should match the original plaintext, demonstrating that the encryption and decryption process was successful.

## Code Walkthrough

### Key and IV Generation

```python
key = get_random_bytes(16)  # 16 bytes = 128 bits key for AES
iv = get_random_bytes(AES.block_size)  # AES block size (16 bytes for AES)
```

- `get_random_bytes(16)` generates a random 128-bit AES key.
- `get_random_bytes(AES.block_size)` generates a random 16-byte IV for AES.

### Encryption

```python
cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CFB, iv)
ciphertext = cipher.encrypt(plaintext.encode())
```

- We create a new AES cipher object using the key and IV, and choose the CFB mode for encryption.
- The plaintext is encoded into bytes and encrypted.

### Hexadecimal Conversion

```python
encoded_ciphertext = hexlify(ciphertext).decode()  # Convert binary to hex
```

- The binary ciphertext is converted into a readable hexadecimal string using `hexlify()`.

### Decryption

```python
decipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CFB, iv)
decryptedtext = decipher.decrypt(ciphertext).decode()
```

- The same key and IV are used to create a decryption object.
- The ciphertext is decrypted back into plaintext.

### Padding Handling

- The program uses `unpad()` (though not explicitly needed in this specific example, since CFB mode doesnâ€™t require padding) to handle padding during encryption and decryption for block ciphers that do require padding (like CBC mode).
